General overview of data | Mozilla and Eclipse are large open source projects. These two projects are diverse in terms of purposes, users and implementation languages, thus help generalizing the conclusions of the experiments on them. They have therefore been used as the primary dataset for all the research relating to mining of software repositories.
Attribute information | This dataset has over 200,000 reported bugs extracted from the Eclipse and Mozilla projects (47,000 and 168,000 respectively). The Eclipse dataset covers the following products - Platforms, JDT, CDT, GEF. The Mozilla dataset includes the following products - Core, Firefox, Thunderbird, Bugzilla
Is this part of a larger series or collection? | Yes
If applicable, include a link to the larger collection | https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org
