###ii. Keywords and Definitions

* **ii1. Data Reduction:** Data reduction for bug triage is the main focus of this paper. The data reduction techniques aim to build small-scale, high-quality set of bug data by removing bug reports and words, which are redundant or non-informative, by combining existing techniques of instance selection and feature selection to simultaneously reduce the bug dimension and the word dimension. The reduced bug data contain fewer bug re- ports and fewer words than the original bug data and pro- vide similar information over the original bug data.

* **ii2. Instance Selection:** Instance selection refers to the process of identifying and elimitating useless instances or superflous instances which can be noisy, from the training set. This helps in obtaining a better and more accurate models for prediction[1]. In the current study, an instance refers to a bug report and instance selection refers to eliminating irrelevant bug reports from the learning stage.

* **ii3. Feature Selection:** It refers to the process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables, predictors) for use in model construction. Some of the attributes or features may be irrelevant and hence should not be considered when building a model because such attributes may introduce noise and tend to reduce the accuracy of predictions. In the current paper, this techiniques is used to remove unwanted fields from bug reports.

* **ii4. A Bug's Life:** Once a software bug is found, a reporter (typically a developer, a tester, or an end user) records this bug to the bug repository. A recorded bug is called a bug report and it has multiple items for detailing the information regarding reproducing the bug. The summary and the description are two key items about the information of the bug, which are recorded in natural languages. Some other items are recorded in a bug report for facilitating the identification of the bug, such as the product, the platform, and the importance. Once a bug report is formed, a human triager assigns this bug to a developer, who will try to fix this bug. The process of assigning a correct developer for fixing the bug is called bug triage. The developer fixes the issue and closes the bug with appropriate comments.

### iii. Brief notes###

#####iii1. Motivational statements

Today, the effective use bug repositories in software development tasks are faced with two challenges - large scale and low quality. Taking Eclipse project as an example, we can see that 30 new bugs were reported everyday in 2007 and a total of 333,371 bugs were stored in the repository from 2001 to 2007. It is a challenge to manually examine each and every bug that has been reported. On the other hand, software techniques suffer from the low quality of bug data. Two typical characteristics of low-quality bugs are noise and redundancy. Noisy bugs may mislead developers while redundant bugs waste the limited time of bug handling. A time-consuming step of handling software bugs is bug triage, which aims to assign a correct developer to fix a new bug. In traditional software development, new bugs are manually triaged by an expert in the field (a human triager). Due to the large number of daily bugs and the lack of expertise of all the bugs, manual bug triage is expensive in time cost and low in accuracy. In manual bug triage in Eclipse, 44 percent of bugs are as- signed by mistake while the time cost between opening one bug and its first triaging is 19.3 days on average.

#####iii2. Hypotheses

Large-scale and low-quality bug data in bug repositories block the techniques of automatic bug triage. Since software bug data are a kind of free-form text data (generated by developers), it is necessary to generate well-processed bug data to facilitate the application. This paper addresses the problem of data reduction for bug triage i.e., it aims to reduce the bug data to save the labor cost of developers and improve the quality to facilitate the process of bug triage. Data reduction for bug triage aims to build a small-scale and high-quality set of bug data by removing bug reports and words, which are redundant or non-informative. The reduced bug data contain fewer bug reports and fewer words than the original bug data and provide similar information over the original bug data. This study has a great impact on "Mining Software Repositories" community. It enables all the other research related to mining software repositories because data reduction will reduce noise and increase the accuracy of the models built on top of these bugs.


#####iii3. Data

The most popular open source datasets from Eclipse and Mozilla projects are used in this study. Eclipse and Mozilla bug repository datasets are very popular in the studies relating to mining software repositories. Apart from having a large, diversified data, these datasets are popularly used because the results obtained in the studies can be compared with results from various other research studies. 

This study empirically investigates 600,000 bug reports (300,000 each, from Mozilla and Eclipse). For each bug report, the web pages from the bug repositories are downloaded and the details of the bug reports are extracted for the experiments.

#####iii4. Informative Visualisations

Some of the important visualizations that ought to be shown for this study are:

1. A typical Bug Report. Each bug report forms an instance, for the instance selection process.

2. Attributes for a bug dataset. These are the attributes that are considered for feature selection.

### iv. Improvements

* iv1. The approach followed in this study can be used as a data processing step in other research studies that require a reduced and accurate data. Thus it is important to discuss the run-time of the approach followed.

* iv2. The accuracy of data reduction decreases for SVM but many of the automated bug triaging research use SVM as a machine learning algorithm. Applying data reduction may not be benefitial in such cases.


### v. Connection to the Initial Paper

Bug triage is an expensive step of software maintenance in both labor cost and time cost. In this paper, the authors combine feature selection with instance selection to reduce the scale of bug data sets as well as improve the data quality. The authors claim that the approach can be included in [2] and see an improvement in results obtained.
